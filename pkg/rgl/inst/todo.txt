To-do:

Add something like pos argument from text() to text3d; 
incorporate plotrix::thigmophobe logic for auto-positioning.

Look into updates to more modern OpenGL, e.g. https://developer.apple.com/opengl/Migrating_to_OpenGL_Core_Profile.mov

Investigate difference between clear3d() and rgl.close()
when subscenes are in use -- see March 3, 2018 presentation.

Think about formula interface for plot3d and persp3d.

Maybe put all newly created obj fields from initObj into one
place in object, so the original object is left unmodified?

add panning mouse mode.

Investigate off-screen rendering: renderbuffer or framebuffer objects,
Xvfb, etc.

Port sphere facet sorting to WebGL.

Draw other nested objects (3d sprites, ...) like spheres are now drawn.  Make sure the new "primitive" functions (getPrimitiveCount, 
getPrimitiveCenter) work for other types besides spheres.


Make X11 optional at configure time.  This is a big job:  all OpenGL calls
depend on X11 on Unix-alikes.

Bug reported on Stackoverflow:  drawing a transparent object after plot3d with
limits puts it in a different subscene, so it may be drawn early and mess up
transparency. PARTLY FIXED:  transparent is always drawn after solid, but 
maybe not in the right order.

Another bug:  planes apparently draw to the Z buffer when transparent.  
NOT FIXED:  transparent things should be drawn in back to front order, so this
is okay.

Support par3d() queries and sets in Shiny. DONE

planes3d() should just store the a,b,c,d parameters, and allow
them to be manipulated directly in Javascript.  It already did,
but vertexSetter didn't know how to manipulate them.  Now it
does.  DONE

Draw spheres one facet at a time when they are transparent so 
overlapping spheres will be rendered properly.  This needs two
meanings for "getElementCount" and "drawElement":  for spheres,
each facet needs to be returned separately. DONE

Add polar mouse control to WebGL. DONE

Fix Javascript so that if we're in ioslides, only 
consider us to be in the viewport if the enclosing slide has class "current".
DONE

Handle loss of context based on two flags:  has context, is visible.  Initialize with context if visible, 
no context if not.  If we have no context, respond to
scrolling/slide change events and get context if we become visible.  If we have a context, can ignore those events,
but need to watch for context lost messages.
When we get a context lost message, set to "no context".
When we get a context restored message, treat as initial.  DONE

Fix bug in setSubsceneEntries (not calling delFrom etc.)

Check through rglExamples and fix errors.
 - bg3d
 
Check that the Javascript changes the JSON values as 
well as the buffer matrix.

Handle all attributes like user attributes in WebGL.

Use shaders in R.  Windows might not support this...

Simplify controls, widgets, etc., and document only the recommended way.  Link from ?play3d, reproducing the example
there.  

Handle background image as in example(bg3d).  Partly done.

Need a toggleButton equivalent. DONE

Make glVersion visible to users. DONE

Use magick package in movie3d. DONE

Generate .Rmd file for examples automatically. DONE.

Add wireframe and dot handling of polygons using extra coordinates:  for triangles, measure distance
from opposite edge in pixels, set extra coordinate for that vertex to (dist, 0, 0).  (Others will be
(0, dist, 0) and (0, 0, dist)).  Then fragments for which all coordinates are greater than linewidth
are discarded.  (For points, need two coords to have small coordinates.) May need to expand the triangle a
bit to allow fat lines outside the range. NOT DONE, BUT
A BETTER APPROACH WORKED.

Try "magick" before "convert" in movie3d. DONE

Allow user-specified shader (for testing the above!)
in WebGL. DONE

Finish fixedSize in rglwidget. DONE

Handle lost context.  See:
https://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/HandlingContextLost.  DONE.

Possibly generate rglwidget() call just before clear
or open operations.  WON'T DO:  it appears in the wrong place in RMarkdown documents.

Need to finish and document rgl.printRglwidget settings.  DONE

Add texture handling to spheres per messages
from Justin McManus (Aug, 2016). DONE

Fix bug in agecontrol: if object has 2 colours but more points, it gets messed up. DONE

Work around 65K vertex limit.  Maybe all we need is the OES_element_index_uint 
extension?  DONE

Improve readOBJ to handle more files. DONE

Fix alias in text and 2D sprites. DONE

Fix interaction of fat lines with ageControl. DONE

Allow single-color objects to be modified by ageControl.  DONE

Maybe make all WebGL objects into indexed objects, to simplify the
code a bit. DONE

Fix circles in transparent linestrips (e.g. example(ageControl)).  DONE, though there are still a few artifacts.

axes3d() with "bbox" doesn't send parameters to bbox3d. FIXED


Investigate crosstalk integration:  see http://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/authoring.html.   DONE

add selection mouse mode. DONE

Bug in lines3d??? example(vertexControl) shows dashed
line in rglwidget(), probably because lines3d is acting
like segments3d. FIXED

Work out behaviour if scene is rotated while brush
is visible.  Should it change the selection, or 
remove the brush?  Yes, FIXED.

Fix auto-sizing of widget when it is in a tagList. DONE using
combineWidgets instead.

Initialize scene based on starting slider value.    DONE
