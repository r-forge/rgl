\title{Set the aspect ratios of the current plot}
\description{
This function sets the apparent ratios of the x, y, and z axes
of the current bounding box.
}
\usage{
aspect3d(x, y = NULL, z = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{The ratio for the x axis, or all three ratios, or \code{"iso"} }
  \item{y}{The ratio for the y axis }
  \item{z}{The ratio for the z axis }
}
\details{
If the ratios are all 1, the bounding box will be displayed as a cube approximately filling the display.
Values may be set larger or smaller as desired.  Aspect \code{"iso"} signifies that the
coordinates should all be displayed at the same scale, i.e. the bounding box should not be
rescaled.  (This corresponds to the default display before \code{aspect3d} has been called.)
Partial matches to \code{"iso"} are allowed.

\code{aspect3d} works by modifying \code{par3d("scale")}.
}
\value{
The previous value of the scale is returned invisibly.
