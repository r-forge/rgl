# Introduction

The `htmlwidget` framework includes both R and Javascript
code.  We'll describe each part in turn, from the top (R level) down.

# rglwidget()

The `rglwidget()` function adds an `rgl` scene to the final web page.

It has static local storage `reuseDF` 
to store information about objects for re-use in later widgets.
This is `NULL` or a dataframe from the `reuse` attribute
of the `convertScene()` result, containing columns `id`, 
`elementId`, `texture`.

If not running in Shiny and not specified in the call, it
assigns a random `elementId` of the form `rglNNNNN`, where
`NNNNN` is 1 to 5 digits.

The value sent as `x` to `createWidget` is produced from
a `scene3d()` record with the following changes:
 
 - All objects including subscenes are included in the `objects` list.  The `rootSubscene` record is replaced with
 its id.
 
 - The `objects` list is named with character string versions
 of the object ids.  They are also kept redundantly as a field
 within the record.
 
 - If an object is in the `reuseDF` dataframe, it is replaced
 with `list(id = <id>, reuse = <elementId>)`.
 
 - `bboxdeco` objects are replaced with primitive versions.
 
 - `flags` are converted to numeric form.
 
 - The model sphere is stored in `sphereVerts`.
 
 - the `par3d$viewport` settings are adjusted in subscenes.
 
 
# rglwidget.js

The `createWidget()` call puts `x` into JSON and calls
the `renderValue` function of the `rglwidget`.  This function
initializes a new `rglwidgetClass` object using the 
`<div>` element and `x`, then checks for uninitialized
controllers and initializes them.

Finally it draws the scene.

# rglClass.src.js

Most of the Javascript code handling drawing is present as
methods of  `rglwidgetClass`.  Unlike the old
`rgl::writeWebGL`, the shaders are generated in Javascript
so changes to objects can result in new shaders being
generated.  Each object is initialized once, then drawn
many times as the viewpoint changes.  Adding or removing 
an object from a scene causes it to be re-initialized.

# rglcontroller()

The `rglcontroller()` function adds a controller to the page.
Most of the controllers are not visible; they are mainly
for use by Shiny controls to affect an `rglwidget()` scene.
