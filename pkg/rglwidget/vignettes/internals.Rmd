# Introduction

The `htmlwidget` framework includes both R and Javascript
code.  We'll describe each part in turn, from the top (R level) down.

# rglwidget()

The `rglwidget()` function adds an `rgl` scene to the final web page.

It has static local storage `reuseDF` 
to store information about objects for re-use in later widgets.
This is `NULL` or a dataframe from the `reuse` attribute
of the `convertScene()` result, containing columns `id`, 
`elementId`, `texture`.  When R produces vignettes for a package,
it doesn't start a new session for each vignette, so this
should be cleared at the start.  The `rgl::setupKnitr()` function
does that.

If not running in Shiny and not specified in the call, it
assigns a random `elementId` of the form `rglNNNNN`, where
`NNNNN` is 1 to 5 digits.

The value sent as `x` to `createWidget` is produced from
a `scene3d()` record with the following changes made by `convertScene()`:
 
 - All objects including subscenes are included in the `objects` list.  The `rootSubscene` record is replaced with
 its id.
 
 - The `objects` list is named with character string versions
 of the object ids.  They are also kept redundantly as a field
 within the record.
 
 - If an object is in the `reuseDF` dataframe, it is replaced
 with `list(id = <id>, reuse = <elementId>)`.  (This relies
 on the fact that we only reuse objects with the same id, we
 never try to match others.)
 
 - `bboxdeco` objects are replaced with primitive versions.
 
 - `flags` are converted to numeric form.
 
 - The model sphere is stored in `sphereVerts`.
 
 - the `par3d$viewport` settings are adjusted in subscenes.
 
 - within individual objects, the `colors` element is dropped
   from the material (since it has already been converted to
   numerical RGB components, it is not needed).
 
 
# rglwidget.js

The `createWidget()` call puts `x` into JSON and calls
the `renderValue` function of the `rglwidget`.  This function
initializes a new `rglwidgetClass` object using the 
`<div>` element and `x`, then checks for uninitialized
controllers and initializes them.

Finally it draws the scene, unless it has found a controller
that will do so.

# playwidget()

The `playwidget()` function adds a widget holding controllers to the page.
Most of the controllers are not visible; they are mainly
for use by Shiny controls to affect an `rglwidget()` scene.

As with `rglwidget()`, a random `elementId` (of the same form)
is generated if not supplied (and not running in Shiny).  

`sceneId` and `respondTo` are HTML ids of the scene to control
and the Shiny control to respond to, respectively.  These and
a list of individual controls are put into a list and passed
as `x` to `createWidget()`.


# subsetControl, propertyControl, ageControl, vertexControl

These are the controls that can be passed in `playwidget()`.  
Each of them sets up data and returns a list
with a field `type` to identify the control and various other
fields to hold data.

# playwidget.js

The `createWidget()` call puts `x` into JSON and calls
the `renderValue` function of the `playwidget`.  This function
attempts to call the `scene.applyControls` corresponding to the
`sceneId`, but it is possible the scene doesn't exist yet.  In that
case we just save the information in the instance data.

If `respondTo` is non-null, we hook into the `onchange` handler
on the named control.  (We chain older handlers, but 
some sketchy code tries not to chain to previous versions of
the same controller hook.)

# rglClass.src.js

Most of the Javascript code handling drawing is present as
methods of  `rglwidgetClass`.  Unlike the old
`rgl::writeWebGL`, the shaders are generated in Javascript
so changes to objects can result in new shaders being
generated.  Each object is initialized once, then drawn
many times as the viewpoint changes.  Adding or removing 
an object from a scene may require it to be re-initialized,
but this is not done automatically (because it tends to
lead to flashy updates, where we try to
display partially incomplete objects).

The `scene.applyControls` method is also part of this class.
It directs handling to separate functions depending on the
value of the `type` field in the control.

The `rglTimerClass` is a class to manage a timer created
by `playwidget()`.  

# setupKnitr()

There are currently two ways to include `rgl` scenes in a
`knitr`/`Rmarkdown` document.  The old way requires
`setupKnitr()` to be called to install hooks into `knitr`;
the newer way is to call `rglwidget()` to insert each image.
The latter still requires `setupKnitr()` to clear the `reuseDF`.

The `knitr` hooks do the following:

 - Looks at the `options` argument to the hook.
 - Possibly opens a new rgl window before the plot.
 - Works out the requested size of plot.
 - Calls `.writeWebGL` to write it.
 - Stores information for future re-use in a local static variable.
