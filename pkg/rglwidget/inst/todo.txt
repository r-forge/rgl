TODO:

DONE:

For those objects where the init method expands the number of vertices,
the control/setter methods need to be modified correspondingly. -- DONE

Vertexsetter needs to be finished and tested.  Done.

Resizing isn't quite working:  canvas width and height need to be
in pixels.  Put the canvas in a div and it should work. Done.

Get reuse working. DONE.

Make resizing less sensitive to scrolling. DONE

Support play3d() for widget.  This could be done like the
sliders in Shiny:  attach the player to the slider, or we could
have an invisible player object which is controlled by buttons,
and which optionally controls a slider. DONE using playControl.

playControl should generate a widget, not be a controller. DONE

Drop rglcontroller widget, have playwidget work with Shiny. Partially
DONE: playwidget works with Shiny, but rglcontroller has been kept,
because it doesn't really make sense to use playwidget.

Set it up so that rgl Suggests rglwidget, all the WebGL work is done
here.  Functions remain in rgl, but they check whether they can
requireNamespace(rglwidgets), and give instructions if not.  DONE
here, not committed in rgl yet.


NOT DONE:

On Windows, the 3d sprites flash annoyingly.  This might be caused by the mouse
events being called while still being serviced.  (Doesn't appear to be.  Not sure
of the cause...)

Other browsers need to be tested. Done on OSX.

Get rmarkdown to do the base64 conversion of embedded images
instead of doing it ourselves; make sure files get cleaned up.

Put bboxdeco rendering into Javascript.  -- looks really time
consuming.

Investigate whether grid displays can be converted to rgl objects.

Add class to rgl function results so that in RStudio they can automatically
be made into widgets.

Do away with subst(), use tags.  Can't completely do away with it,
we need to write Javascript sometimes, but we can make less use of it.

Style the controls using CSS, not Javascript.

Get rid of old style Javascript insertion of controls, always use
widget.
