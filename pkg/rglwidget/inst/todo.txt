TODO:

For those objects where the init method expands the number of vertices,
the control/setter methods need to be modified correspondingly.

On Windows, the 3d sprites flash annoyingly.  This might be caused by the mouse
events being called while still being serviced.  (Doesn't appear to be.  Not sure
of the cause...)

Other browsers need to be tested. Done on OSX.

Vertexsetter needs to be finished and tested.  Done.
