RGL Version 0.66 [r420 / 2006-02-24]

DESCRIPTION
The RGL package is a visualization device system for R, using 
OpenGL as the rendering backend. An rgl device at its core 
is a real-time 3D engine written in C++. It provides an 
interactive viewpoint navigation facility (mouse + wheel support)
and an R programming interface.

RELEASE INFO
Small bugfix release due to new package conventions in R

CHANGES IN 0.66
* Changes for compatibility with strict enforcement of file naming rules in R 2.3.0.

* Fixed display list memory leak when drawing shapes (e.g. spheres)

* Added "all" and "viewpoint" to rgl.clear and clear3d

* Added static libpng build support and user customizable prefix (unix)

* Uses xyz.coords in all functions taking x, y, z coordinates, allowing
  matrix or dataframe arguments (among others)

* Added par3d(skipRedraw=TRUE) to allow drawing to be done without
  being rendered

WHATS NEW 0.65
* A native Mac OS X / Carbon version is shipped with this release.
  No need to start an X11 Server. 
  The X11 Port is still available, but configure defaults to use Carbon.

* The X11 port has been improved. The crash (using rgl.close() or rgl.quit()
  has been fixed.

* User-selectable mouse handlers featuring trackball navigation and 
  interactive selection.

* A new interface concept "R3D" is available for preview and discussion 
  using the function name pattern:
    XXX3d() 

  The functions map to rgl functions internally (with some exceptions).

  Here's a short list of interesting spots in the interface API:

  * par3d() can be used to get/set values on the current RGL device.

  * Primitives functions such as points3d(), lines3d(), surface3d(), ...

  * First bunch of generic transformation utilities, rendering methods 
    and mesh objects are implemented.

  The rgl interface using the pattern "rgl.XXX()" is still available.
  You can decide between more OpenGL/RGL'is low-level functions or
  more R'ish functions using the R3D interface concept.

* Rendering of blended surfaces using hierarchical z-sorting.

* New material property: Texture environment mapping
