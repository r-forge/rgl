BUILDING RGL ON WIN32
=====================


BUILD TOOLS
-----------

- MinGW (v3.2.3) [default]

BUILD TOOL REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------

- ActiveState Perl (v5.8.2)
- Microsoft HTML Help Workshop (v4.74.8702)
- precompiled Rtools[1] or CygWin
  If one encounters problems when cleaning up the zlib source
  tree, try CygWin instead.
- environment variable TMPDIR is set to a temporary directory.


PREPARING THE SOURCE
--------------------
  Make sure the R_HOME variable is set to the
  source directory in 'unix' notation.

  zlib and libpng are used from the R directory.
  Make sure you built R with Rbitmap support, so
  that the libpng sources are available from that
  directory.  

    
BUILD
-----

   > Rcmd INSTALL rgl


	
APPENDIX: R BUILD ENVIRONMENT
-----------------------------
the order of tools in the PATH chain is important:

using r-tools:
  first 'r-tools'
  then mingw, perl, html helpwork shop, R bin directory
  
using cygwin:
  perl and mingw comes before cygwin 
  (otherwise cygwin-gcc and cygwin-perl would be used)
  html help workshop and R bin directory
    
set TMPDIR variable to point to some temporary directory.
