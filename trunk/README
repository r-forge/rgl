RGL - 3D visualization device system for R using OpenGL
=======================================================

INTRODUCTION
------------
The RGL package is a visualization device system for R, using 
OpenGL as the rendering backend. An rgl device at its core 
is a real-time 3D engine written in C++. It provides an 
interactive viewpoint navigation facility (mouse + wheel support)
and an R programming interface.

See "COPYING" textfile for details.


FEATURES
--------
- portable R Plug-in using OpenGL on win32 and X11
- R programming interface 
- interactive viewpoint navigation
- automatic data focus
- geometry primitives: 
  points, lines, triangles, quads, texts, point sprites
- high-level geometry:
  surface, spheres
- up to 8 light sources
- alpha-blending (transparency)
- side-dependant fill-mode rendering (dots,wired and filled)
- texture-mapping support (rgb, alpha and luminance)
- environmental effects:
  fogging, background sphere
- bounding box with axis ticks marks
- undo operation:
  shapes and light-sources are managed on type stacks,
  where the top-most objects can be pop'ed


PLATFORMS & BUILD TOOLS
-----------------------
un*x/x11 (gcc)
win32 (MinGW/gcc, MSVC 6, devcpp)


REQUIREMENTS
------------
Windowing System (x11 or win32)
OpenGL and GLU Library (implementation for X11 or Win32)

OPTIONS
-------
libpng library


BUILDING/INSTALLING THE SOURCE PACKAGE
--------------------------------------
The R build tool ("R CMD build" (un*x) / "Rcmd BUILD" (win32) ) 
is the primary tool to build the RGL package.

The building process comes in two flavours X11/Un*x and windows.

Please read the appropriate README file:

README.X11                  building on un*x/x11
README.WIN32                building on windows
 
For the windows platform, there are also precompiled binary
zip packages available. 


LOADING LIBRARY AND RUNNING DEMONSTRATIONS
------------------------------------------

> library(rgl)
> demo(rgl)


KNOWN BUGS
----------
- X11: rgl.close() and rgl.shutdown might crash
